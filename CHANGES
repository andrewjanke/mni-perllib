Release 0.01 (13 August, 1997)
* first alpha release -- just enough to convert John Sled's N3 package
  to use the library
* there are still problems with running the test suite anywhere except
  the PET SGIs, though

Release 0.02 (18 August, 1997)
* second alpha release -- fixed bugs in 0.01:
  - register_programs in MNI::Spawn now works 
  - improved error handling and messages in MNI::Spawn
  - more tests added to MNI::Spawn suite (check error/warning messages
    for common error situations; tests register_programs)
  - MNI::MincUtilities now autoloaded, and turns off MNI::Spawn's 
    `strict' option
  - fixed MNI::MincUtilities test suite so it still runs OK (with warnings)
    if certain external programs aren't found (volume_stats, volume_cog)
  - changes to MNI::MiscUtilities and MNI::PathUtilities test suites
    for improved portability

Release 0.03 (28 August, 1997)
* fixed two bugs in MNI::Startup: 
  - program crash was being masked ($? reset to zero on cleanup)
  - order of operations all wrong (startup code executed before
    import list processed)
* added the "skip_ext" argument to MNI::PathUtilities::split_path
* added the "doc" directory, with a system for generating a full-blown
  reference manual by converting the pods to LaTeX and putting them into
  one big document

Release 0.04 (23 September, 1997)
* added MNI::DataDir module (required changes to Makefile.PL to support
  building the module itself from DataDir.pm.in)
* changed MNI::Startup so it requires $Verbose true to print CPU times
* fixed MNI::MincUtilities::compute_reshape_args
* changed MNI::Startup to be more intelligent about which signals to
  install handlers for
* fixed MNI::PathUtilities::normalize_dirs so it silently skips 
  undefined values

Release 0.05 (3 October, 1997)
* fixed MNI::Spawn test suite to not rely on the system's 'ls' by 
  providing my own 'toy_ls' program
* a multitude of other fixes to the test suite -- due to changed features,
  new features, newly-fixed bugs, and bugs in the test programs themselves
* fixed MNI::FileUtilities::search_directories: no longer silently modifies
  the passed-in directories
* added code to MNI::Spawn::spawn and MNI::Startup::self_announce allowing
  the former (in a parent process) to control whether the latter (in a child
  process) should actually make its announcement
* changed MNI::Startup to only 'rm -rf' its original $TmpDir
* greatly reduced MNI::Startup's startup overhead by delaying/avoiding 
  loading other modules when possible
* added capability to supply specific program paths to RegisterPrograms
  in the MNI::Spawn module
* various documentation fixes, enhancements, clarifications, and 
  typographical standardization
