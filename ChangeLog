Sun Jan 16 15:37:54 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* MNI.pm: bump VERSION to 0.06.

Sun Jan 16 15:16:02 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* MNI/Tag.pm (load, save): qualify `open' and `close' calls with CORE:: to 
	distinguish them from Tag::open and Tag::close.

Sun Jan 16 14:58:54 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* NEWS: new file.  Summary of USER-visible changes between
 	releases.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (StartJob): clear %SyncFiles before assigning to it
 	when starting new job; otherwise old values for same JobPID will
 	be returned.

	* t/batch-0.t: new file.  Test basic features of MNI::Batch.pm,
 	mostly the return values.

	* t/batch-1.t: renamed from 'batch.t' in order that it be executed
	_after_ batch-0.t.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (QueueCommands): return startfile (if StartJob
 	called), along with finish and fail files.

Sat Dec 18 08:55:23 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm (_queue_one_command): bugfix.  If passed an array
	ref, take program name from first element of array to avoid
	becoming confused by shellquote's quoting of metacharacters.

Fri Dec 17 17:59:20 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm (_queue_one_command): code reorganization; there is
	now no useful return value.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (QueueCommands): code reorganization; clean up pod
	documentation.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (Synchronize): code reorganization and bugfix.  The
	old computation for $numjobs overcounted in the case that some
	jobs synchronize on 'start' and some synchronize on 'finish'.  We
	now count just the jobs that synchronize for the desired
	condition.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (FinishJob): code reorganization; now returns
	array of filenames (finishfile, failfile).  For backwards
	compatibility, returns scalar finishfile in scalar context.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (StartJob): code reorganization, no semantic
	changes.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (_emit_rmtmpdir_shellcode): 
	* MNI/Batch.pm (_emit_mktmpdir_shellcode): 
	* MNI/Batch.pm (_emit_syncfile_shellcode): new.  Write shell
	code to BATCH filehandle.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (_set_syncfile_name): new.  Generate syncfile
	name for given condition and store in %SyncFiles.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (create_sync_file): split into two subroutines:
	_set_syncfile_name and _emit_syncfile_shellcode.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (_syncfile_name): renamed to _get_syncfile_name;
	$pid defaults to $JobPID if not specified.

	* t/batch.t (wait_for_files): test that StartJob() returns a
	defined start file and that FinishJob() returns (in scalar
	context) a defined finish file.

Thu Dec  9 16:52:04 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MNI/Tag.pm (copy): croak if copy is not invoked on a valid
	reference.

1999-12-02  Chris Cocosco  <crisco@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm: functionality changes! 
	= 'fail' sync files are now _not_ created unless the "synchronize"
	option is set to 'finish' or 'both'.
	= "syncdir" now defaults to './.sync' if 'HOME' is not defined in
	the environment (which is the case for CGI scripts for example)
	
1999-12-02  Chris Cocosco  <crisco@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm: new option: 'batch_reports'
	("should the underlying batch process run in verbose mode?")
	Unless the user explicitly sets it, this option defaults to
	whatever value 'verbose' has.

	[*Caveat*] the text produced by the underlying process goes to
	STDOUT even if the 'verbose' text (which is produced by Batch.pm)
	is redirected somewhere else by means of the 'loghandle' option

1999-11-30  Chris COCOSCO  <crisco@thaisa.bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MNI/FileUtilities.pm (check_files): documentation fixes.

	* MNI/Batch.pm: documentation fixes.
	(set_undefined_option): made it more robust (now it
	can properly handle the case when the calling package is
	MNI::Spawn and not main:: )
	(StartJob): fixed a bug related to set_undefined_option

	* MNI/Spawn.pod: added a clarification about redirection clobber
	when using batch.

1999-11-17  Chris COCOSCO  <crisco@thaisa.bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MNI/Spawn.pm: added a carp warning about the redirection
	clobber/append when running through batch.

Wed Oct 27 18:38:15 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm (create_sync_file): use underscore rather than
 	period to sanitize names; files with leading periods are a
 	nuisance to find using 'ls'.

Tue Oct 26 13:24:13 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MNI/Tag.pm (save): don't use self->{_comments} if it
	isn't defined.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (create_sync_file): sanitize sync file names by
	replacing any non-safe character with a period.

Fri Oct 22 17:47:24 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* t/batch.t (test): register programs spawned during the tests.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (QueueCommands): now returns *both* the fail file
	and the finish file names.  For backwards compatibilty, only the 
	finish file is returned in scalar context.

Thu Oct 14 18:34:16 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MNI/Tag.pm: add code to update tag coordinates and write tags to
 	file.  The tag code still ignores comments and "auxiliary" data.

	* MNI/Tag.pm(new): for creating a new tag file; this is a change
 	in constructor semantics!

	* MNI/Tag.pm(open): for opening existing tag file; this is what
	the old "new" constructor did.

	* t/example1.tag:
	* t/tag.t: new files.  Regression testing for MNI::Tag.

	* preptest:
	* preptest.sh:
	* rlog.out: removed junk files.

Tue Oct 12 12:40:48 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm: typos in documentation.

Fri Aug 13 20:12:12 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MNI/Tag.pm: new file.  Manipulate tag files as perl objects.

Thu Aug 12 14:17:14 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm (_batch_optstring): fixed 'shell' option; forgot to
 	lowercase it when making the previous changes.

Wed Aug 11 19:46:41 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm: don't lexically scope ProgramName.

Sun Aug  8 17:11:58 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm (create_sync_file): take care when job_name is not
 	defined.

Sat Aug  7 16:58:16 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm: all package variables, other than @ISA,
 	@EXPORT_OK, and %EXPORT_TAGS localised with `my'.  Option
 	identifiers changed to "lower_case_underscore_separated", the
 	style used in MNI::Spawn.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (StartJob): all parameters are optional, passed in
 	"key => value" style.  Return value changed to be the name of the
 	`start' sync file, if any; return value was previously the JobPID
 	(undocumented).

	* MNI/Batch.pm (FinishJob): new option `close_delay' used if delay
 	not given as parameter.  Return value is name of `finish' sync
 	file, if any.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (QueueCommand): QueueCommand() will call StartJob
 	and FinishJob if no job open; no longer carps about this usage.
  	If QueueCommand calls FinishJob, the name of the `finish' sync
 	file, if any, is returned.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (QueueCommands): if QueueCommands calls FinishJob,
 	the name of the `finish' sync file, if any, is returned.

	* t/batch.t: updated to account for changes to Batch.pm; no new
 	test coverage.

Fri Aug  6 18:09:11 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* MNI/Spawn.pm (spawn): batch's QueueCommand option MergeErrors
 	became merge_stderr.

Tue Jul 27 19:00:42 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm (Synchronize): fix documentation of return value.
  	Return ref to empty array if not executing.

	* MNI/Batch.pm: Allow `JobName', `StartAfter', `MergeErrors',
 	`stdout', and `stderr' as global options.

	* MNI/Spawn.pm (spawn): change parameters for Batch::QueueCommand
 	call.

Thu Jul 22 19:52:36 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm (gen_batch_options, StartJob, QueueCommand): allow
 	overriding any option on a per-job basis.  Implement `StartAfter' 
	option, passed on to batch as `-a'.
	(StartJobAfter): removed function.

	* t/batch.t: bugfix (start_batchtest) and changes related to above.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (QueueCommands): compacted the code.  No semantic
 	changes made.

Tue May 18 18:36:39 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm (StartJobAfter): experimental batch interface using
 	'-a' option to delay a job.  This really ought to be specified
	via Batch( job, After => whatever, ... ), like the Spawn interface.

Mon May 17 16:41:18 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* t/batch.t: added simple testing of StartJob, QueueCommand,
 	QueueCommands, and FinishJob.  No testing of synchronization, yet.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (QueueCommands): StartBatchJob --> StartJob typo
 	fixed.  Expand documentation; all options documented.

Thu May 13 19:33:40 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* t/batch.t: new file.  Start of MNI::Batch regression tests.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (Synchronize): rearrange the code slightly.  Returns
	true if -noexecute.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (QueueCommands): fix bug that prevented method
	from working.

	* MNI/Batch.pm: add pod documentation.  Remove $fakeJobPID.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (sync_file_name): folded into create_sync_file().

Wed May 12 18:52:39 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MANIFEST: add MNI/Batch.pm.

Wed May 12 18:44:49 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* doc/.cvsignore: new file.

	* doc/Makefile (SOURCE,TMPDIRS): remove Getopt stuff.

Wed May 12 18:23:10 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* .cvsignore:
	* MNI/.cvsignore:
	* t/.cvsignore: new files.

	* MANIFEST: removed getopt-related files.

	* Makefile.PL (PMLIBDIRS): removed Getopt.

Wed May 12 16:56:06 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm: new file.
	* MNI/Spawn.pm: Chris Cocosco's batch enhancements, a port from
	older batch code of Greg.

Wed May 12 16:51:54 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* ChangeLog: new file.

	* Initial import of Greg Ward's MNI perl library.  This is based
 	on the version 0.05 sources found in ~greg/src/libperl/mnilib/
	with the following removals:

	Getopt: released in own package ``Getopt::Tabular''.
	Makefile.old: built file (from Makefile.PL)
	junk: directory full of assorted test code
	log2: contains the message `junk/shred: this goes to log2'
	mni_perllib-0.05.tar.gz: tar package of code
